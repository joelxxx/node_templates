Log into the table using ssh

1. turn on the table
2. get the IP address from the phone app in advanced
3. log in with ssh
4. look at the logfiles in  /var/log/sisyphus
5. you can delete them to start over   
  sudo rm -fr /var/log/sisyphus/*
6. you can restart the bot using
  cd ~/sisyphus/sisproxy   (not sure of first part of this path)
  sudo ./restart.sh &

We have 3 files. 
server.js
sisbot.js
plotter.js

The idea is to replace the current logEvent with calls to the new logging system.

1. Put the new system into server.js
2. Try to get any log message to come out (cheese or whatever)
  line 182 looks like a good place
3. After you change code is sisbot, you have to 
  sudo rm -fr /var/log/sisyphus/*
  cd ../sisproxy 
  sudo ./restart.sh &

  the look in their logs /var/log/sisyphus/*
  and in your logs configured for wherever you put the cheese log file
  
4. If you get that working, try and call new logging from sisbot.js file
