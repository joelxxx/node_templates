Migration off bind, preparation

NEXT_STEPS
  one template
√    review and re-run undertest
√    add some new models to undertest like the youtube
    try and use backbone view with underscore template....
    
    setup that model and do stuff with it
    name them like sisbot etc
  partials
    get one html to load in another and show it
    set it up to do so conditionally
    make tabs at the bottom and swappy it

  

The idea here is to build up to using
  node
  express
  template language (underscore and mustache look to be the leaders right now)
  backbone (for the data models)
Then build up to having template language with partials
  that should do it for replacing bind


Here are the directories and what's in them so far



basic  (with NODE DEBUGGING)
  a basic node app with express
  https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
  node --inspect app.js
  then in chrome, new tab and  chrome://inspect
    chrome will list app.js under targets, click that and it opens debugger tools



undertest
  node app.js
  
  uses underscore and does server side template application
